# Personal portfolio website

This is the first iteration on the portfolio website. An attempt to build something from scratch and keep it minimal. Will probably be deprecated in future as its easier to build and iterate using some of the open source templates for Hugo. Website - www.inspectorfowler.com

Usage of simple HTML + CSS with a feedback form. Hosted on www.bluehost.com. Artwork and design self made for testing and learning purposes. Sample screenshots below -
